            <h4>Dump files that typically contain:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>CPU context (register data) as it was at the time the crash
                    occurred, and an
                    indication of which thread caused the crash. General-purpose
                    registers are
                    included, as are special-purpose registers such as the
                    instruction pointer
                    (program counter).
                </li>
                <li>Information about each thread of execution within a crashed
                    process,
                    including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The memory region used for each threadâ€™s stack.</li>
                        <li>CPU context for each thread, which for various
                            reasons is not the same
                            as the crash context in the case of the crashed
                            thread.

                <li>A list of loaded code segments (or modules), including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The name of the file (<code>.so</code>,
                            <code>.exe</code>, <code>.dll</code>, etc.) which
                            provides the
                            code.
                        </li>
                        <li>The boundaries of the memory region in which the
                            code segment is visible
                            to the process.
                        </li>
                        <li>A reference to the debugging information for the
                            code module, when such
                            information is available.
